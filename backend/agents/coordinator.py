applied severity, test (CT, X-ray, lab results) and level rules; capacity is shown separately):

Inpatients who can move on to make room, and admitted ER patients waiting for an upstairs bed
("may_go_to" is their only allowed list):
{json.dumps(movable)}

Free beds per unit right now: {json.dumps(units)}

Write ONE plan:
1. Place the most critical waiting patients first, in the best unit from their "may_go_to".
2. If that unit is full, FIRST move an inpatient out of it to free a bed (e.g. an improving ICU patient to
   STEPDOWN), then place the patient. A make-room move must come BEFORE the move that uses the bed.
   Freeing a proper bed is better than a HALLWAY bed; use HALLWAY/PACU only when nothing can be freed.
3. Never move a patient to a unit outside their "may_go_to". Never exceed free beds (count freed beds).
4. Escalations: only from the allowed list, only when clearly needed; a human approves them.
5. summary: one or two short sentences a person with no medical background understands. Everyday words only
   (say "moving patients out", not "decanting"; "close-watch beds", never "step-down"; "intensive care", not "ICU capacity").
   The unit called STEPDOWN in the data is the "close-watch beds": patients who no longer need intensive care but still need watching.
   Refer to patients by name if at all, never by id. Call RESUS "the critical care room", PACU "the recovery room",
   HALLWAY "extra hallway beds", LOUNGE "the going-home lounge"; never say "resus", "PACU" or "ICU capacity".
Use only patient ids listed above. Choose units, never bed numbers. Code re-checks every move.
Never give clinical instructions."""
