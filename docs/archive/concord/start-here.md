# Concord — everything in one place

HopHacks 2026 · Johns Hopkins · Sept 18–20 · team of 2

**The project in one sentence:** a hospital command board that will not move a
patient when the records behind that decision disagree with each other.

**The pitch line:** we don't flag every contradiction — we flag the ones that are
about to change where a patient goes.

## Before the clock starts

1. Download the pre-built Synthea 1K FHIR R4 sample from synthea.mitre.org/downloads
   into `data/synthea/`. **Do not run the generator** — it takes over four hours.
2. Open one bundle and read it by hand. Judges will ask to see one.
3. Agree the JSON contract (PRD, "The contract between us") with your teammate on paper.
4. Create Gemini and Vite accounts/keys.

**Hackathon rule:** the first commit must be after kickoff. Downloading data is fine;
writing code is not.

## The three things that can never be cut

1. The conflict injector
2. The answer key and the accuracy score it enables
3. Clickable provenance on every conflict

Those three are the project. Everything else is presentation.

## The line to never cross

Concord never says which record is right. It says the sources disagree and a human
must resolve it. The moment software gives a single clinical instruction in an urgent
situation, it is a regulated medical device.
